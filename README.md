# Explain version control
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.

# Explain difference berween git and github
**Git:** Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

**GitHub:** GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

# Explain the difference between git fetch and gitpull
**Git Fetch** command is used to fetch all changes from the remote repository to the local repository. It doesnâ€™t make any changes to the current working directory. It stores all the changes in a separate branch called the remote-tracking branch. git merge or git rebase command is used to merge these changes into our current working directory.

**Git pull** is a command which is used to fetch and integrate the changes which are present in the remote repository to the local repository.

# Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it
To rebase the current branch onto another branch, run: git rebase <base> In this command, <base> refers to the branch or commit to rebase the current branch onto. This command takes the changes from the current branch and applies them on top of the specified base branch or commit.


# Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it 
is a command in Git that allows you to apply the changes made in one or more existing commits to your current working tree and index. The command for it is -git cherry-pick
